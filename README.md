This is a clone of the [Workspace Grid](https://github.com/zakkak/workspace-grid) extension. I was not able to wrap my head around Workspace Grid so I started to implement my own extension to get the features I wanted.

## Features

- Configurable number of rows and columns of the workspace grid.
- Workspace thumbnails with live previews of the workspaces.
- Configurable scale of the workspace thumbnails.
- Configurable timeout of the workspace switcher popup.
- Two (optional) wraparound modes for navigating workspaces.
