[![install-extension-green.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/install-extension-green.svg)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1485/workspace-matrix/) (in review, you can install the [latest release](https://github.com/mzur/gnome-shell-wsmatrix/releases) manually)

GNOME shell extension to arrange workspaces in a two dimensional grid with workspace thumbnails.

This is a clone of the [Workspace Grid](https://github.com/zakkak/workspace-grid) extension. I was not able to wrap my head around Workspace Grid so I started to implement my own extension to get the features I wanted.

## Features

- Allows free configuration of the number of rows and columns of the workspace grid.
- Shows workspace thumbnails with live previews of the workspaces.
- Allows free configuration of the scale of the workspace thumbnails.
